Spring Demo Exercise Based on https://www.baeldung.com/spring-boot-start as an Exercise in İ2İ Systems Internship

I initialized the Spring Boot project as a web application using Spring Tool Suite (STS) in Eclipse. During setup, I included essential dependencies such as Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, H2 Database, Spring Security, Thymeleaf, and Spring Boot Test. I first ran and verified the application successfully from Eclipse as a Spring Boot web app. Later, I exported the project to IntelliJ IDEA to implement and run integration tests using REST Assured, as demonstrated in the screenshots. The tests were executed under @SpringBootTest with a randomized port to verify the functionality of the Books API endpoints, confirming that CRUD operations worked as expected within a fully initialized Spring context. I got most of the code from the specified link but I added two files for the exception handling called BookIdMismatchException and BookNotFoundException in the exception folder.
